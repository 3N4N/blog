So when I stepped outside today at ten a.m., it was the first time in two years I have seen the sun from outside the building I eat, shit, and sleep in.
I did not miss the constant stink of spilled garbage in this city, but the perfect temperature and pleasant breeze more than made up for it.</description></item><item><title>Using Claws Mail Client</title><link>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/techtalk/2020-08-28-using-claws-mail/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/techtalk/2020-08-28-using-claws-mail/</guid><description>Contents Why Install Add Account Compose Email FAQ Why? Why use an email-client? I do not know. Except that using an external email-client seems like a grown-up thing to do, like owning a wallet.
Why use Claws Mail? I guess because it uses less resource than others. But, having a modern computer, that sounds more like an excuse than a valid reason.
Basically, the reason will depend on the user.</description></item><item><title>Racism vs Colorism</title><link>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/2020/07/racism-vs-colorism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/2020/07/racism-vs-colorism/</guid><description>A friend of mine posted a humorous status on Facebook, satirizing the Bangladeshi people who were agreeing with the Black Lives Matter movement in America. His argument was that we prefer women with lighter skin tone to darker one, and so we have no right to judge Americans while being entrenched in racism ourselves.
Of course, he and I both knew that sexual attraction has little to do with racism, but I could not shake the feeling of a deep-rooted connection between the two.</description></item><item><title>Fight Club: A Coming-of-Age Film</title><link>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/filmtalk/2020-07-14-fight-club-a-coming-of-age-film/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/filmtalk/2020-07-14-fight-club-a-coming-of-age-film/</guid><description>Disclaimer Like any ambiguous movie, Fight Club has many interpretations, and everyone is free to interpret it in their own way. That is the beauty of films, or any kind of art. The point of this essay is not to say your reading is wrong or that mine is right. The point is to write down my interpretation &amp;hellip; and that is all.
Introduction Due to its very nature, Fight Club has repeatedly been misunderstood by its fans and haters alike.</description></item><item><title>Midsommar and Emotional Dependency</title><link>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/filmtalk/2020-07-04-midsommar-and-emotional-dependency/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/filmtalk/2020-07-04-midsommar-and-emotional-dependency/</guid><description>Midsommar explores a variety of subjects: anxiety, insecurity, loss, grief, betrayal, abandonment issues.

Yes, dazzling locations, thrilling plot, and heartwarming themes are all well and good, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t have well-developed characters, your story will fall flat on its misshapen ass. People don&amp;rsquo;t read stories for locations (they could browse Instagram for that), nor for plot (they could skim the synopsis if that was the case). People read stories for characters they could spend some alone time with without feeling lonely.</description></item><item><title>In Praise of Horror</title><link>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/filmtalk/2020-04-04-in-praise-of-horror/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/filmtalk/2020-04-04-in-praise-of-horror/</guid><description>Genre Snobbery Exists Ever heard of genre snobbery?

The masked duo are the best example of Nemesis in creative media.
The Definitive Version For me and most of my generation, Christopher Nolan&amp;rsquo;s The Dark Knight is the definitive version of Batman and Joker. There have been plenty of adaptations featuring these two characters, but none had the sweeping success and widespread recognition The Dark Knight had.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 17:51:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://3n4n.github.io/enansblog/about/</guid><description>Enan Ajmain is a CSE graduate from Bangladesh.
