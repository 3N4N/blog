Enan Ajmain is a CSE graduate from Bangladesh. He identifies as a vim
user and will let you know that every chance he gets. Other than
dipping his toes into open-source software communities, Enan doesn't
do much within the tech domain. His unguarded passion lies in film and
literature. Give him some space and some books to dive into and he
will be forever content.

You can talk to him about vim, film, or literature at [his email][email].
