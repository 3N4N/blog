<h2 id=genre-snobbery-exists>Genre Snobbery Exists</h2>
<p>Ever heard of genre snobbery? It means laughing at a genre because
some people decided it is beneath the taste of sophisticated people.
Critiques and writers alike from literary fiction side have been
turning up their noses at genre fiction since the beginning of time.
These &ldquo;unsophisticated&rdquo; genres include Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Horror.</p>
<h2 id=sci-fi-and-fantasy-are-awesome>Sci-Fi and Fantasy are Awesome</h2>
<p>Thanks to celebrated writers like Ray Bradbury and H.G. Wells, Sci-Fi
genre has garnered much deserved attention in literary societies. Due
to unprecedented success of movies like the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>
trilogy and <em>Harry Potter</em> series, Fantasy genre, too, now receives
the appreciation it deserves.</p>
<h2 id=horror-is-still-niche>Horror is Still Niche</h2>
<p>The genre still struggling to gasp in the air above the drowning sea
of snobbery is Horror. While it has always had a dedicated fanbase who
celebrate the genre with all its gory glory, the so-called literary
society still does not see the value of Horror in literature. It can
be argued that the situation is changing because of macabre authors
like Stephen King. But even he, one of the most prolific and
masterclass author, gets snubbed in literary circles.</p>
<h2 id=genre-and-setting>Genre and Setting</h2>
<p>Truth is, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, these are all just settings so that
the reader knows what to expect. They present no boundary whatsoever
in the quality of fiction. They just give the writer the leeway he
needs to explore his ideas.</p>
<p>People who do not like horror often says stories with gratuitous
violence, stupid plots, and stupider characters do not hold much value
for them. They are right of course. There are many horror stories that
are just that: gratuitous violence. But that is like saying all
fantasy stories are about Elves, Dwarves and a Dark One. Yes, due to
the success of <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, many authors have written
uncountable stories uncannily similar to it. Most of them are
objectively bad. But Game of Thrones has taught people what Fantasy
can offer: everything. How? Because, Fantasy is not a boundary, it is
just a setting.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-good-horror>What Makes Good Horror</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about the elements of good horror stories. Cause there are
some bad ones. Neither the fans nor the haters of the genre would
downplay their disdain for jump scares. Jump scare is a pathetic
device for writers who does not have more effective tools in his
repertoire.</p>
<p>So, what makes good horrors?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Believable plot.</strong> It&rsquo;s not like you cannot have any fantastical
element in the story. You can. You just need to do the
worldbuilding and weave the story around the fantastical elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sympathetic characters.</strong> Good horror stories, like any other
stories (except maybe idealistic Sci-Fi), are about people. If the
reader or the viewer does not sympathize with the characters, they
are going to feel disconnected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Horror elements the characters have connection with.</strong> This is
the most important aspect of a horror story which most writers do
not bother to work on. Five friends visiting a random haunted house
and getting killed while having an orgy is, at best, bad fiction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=show-not-tell>Show, Not Tell</h2>
<p>Talking and reading about ideas feels like academic work. Boring and
draining. So, examples from a few good horror stories follow.</p>
<h3 id=the-shining-stephen-king-novel>The Shining (Stephen King novel)</h3>
<p>A father has to stay as a maintainer in a haunted hotel, which has
been emptied out for the winter because the area it is situated at is
cut-off from the rest of the world due to heavy snowfall, with his
wife and six-year-old son. On surface level, it would appear that this
is exactly the random haunted house narrative device I said was bad.
But this particular story has a lot more to offer than others.</p>
<p>The dad was an alcoholic. He had had many problems earlier in his life
because of heavy drinking, from beating up his students in drunken
episodes to (possibly) killing a child in a road accident. But, after
he broke his baby son&rsquo;s hand in drunken rage, he took some help and
had at last been able to keep the demons of alcohol at bay.</p>
<p>Until the Overlook Hotel possessed him and tried to murder his family.</p>
<p>You might think, &ldquo;How is this better than any other haunted house
story? It&rsquo;s just more of the same old thing.&rdquo; Let me tell you, it&rsquo;s
not. As stated before, the dad was an alcoholic, and, although he had
been sober for a respectable amount of time, the narrative of the
novel pointedly shows how alluring the beckon of a wine bottle is to
him. He has done terrible things in drunken stupor before. Both his
wife and son know he can become violent if he starts drinking again.
He, too, knows that. But he starts drinking anyway when the pressure
of isolation breaks him and the hotel manipulates his perception of
his wife, portraying her in a villainous frame.</p>
<p>The haunted hotel just provides the writer with a setting, a leeway,
for exploring the cause and effect of alcoholism. Yes, a sobered up
alcoholic will not be forced to start drinking because of a haunted
house in the real world, but he will always be on the brink of falling
on the same dangerous behavior if his friends and family do not
support him properly. The Shining is a brilliant portrayal of how
someone and his whole family can be mortally doomed because of heavy
drinking.</p>
<p>If you put some random people in the Overlook Hotel and killed them,
it would not have the same connection between the characters and the
horror elements. The whole story would fall flat on its ass in the
gutter.</p>
<h3 id=the-invisible-man-2020-movie>The Invisible Man (2020 movie)</h3>
<p>Originally created by H.G. Wells in his 1897 novel with the same name,
the character of the Invisible Man has been prevalent in pop culture
since forever. The original story dealt with the possible catastrophe
one man could inflict upon the society if he were to be given the
ability to be invisible. The premise might seem bonkers. &ldquo;Why would we
explore the implications of invisibility? It&rsquo;s not like someone has
invented the Invisibility Cloak.&rdquo; Well, guess what? Somebody has. It&rsquo;s
called the Internet.</p>
<p>Anyway, the allegory of invisibility to anonymity is from the original
novel. It was a very good horror novel in its own right, but this
section is not about that particular novel, so let&rsquo;s get back to the
film.</p>
<p>The movie is about a woman escaping from an abusive relation. Her
partner at first restricted her connection to the outside world, then
her movement around and outside the house, and gradually even her
opinions and thoughts. So, she flees from what can essentially be
called captivity. But, as she struggles to get back to normal
lifestyle following the trauma of the abusive relation, her partner
comes back and haunts her, now completely invisible.</p>
<p>Any victim of abuse goes through a period of trauma. Some of them
can&rsquo;t overcome it completely at all. During this period, she (I&rsquo;ll use
feminine pronoun for the character of victim here because of the
characterization in the movie, and also because I did the inverse in
the previous section) has to look behind her shoulder all the time to
convince herself that her abuser is not back to hurt her again. Abuse
not only hurts physically, it breaks the mental strength and
self-confidence of the victim.</p>
<p>This movie explores the idea of always being scared of more abuse
because of past abuse in a clever way. In the movie the abuser
actually does come back to hurt her, which won&rsquo;t happen in real life
(hopefully), or at least, won&rsquo;t happen the way it did in the movie.
But it provides a picture to understand the harrowing experience the
victims of abuse go through. That is good horror.</p>
<h3 id=the-haunting-of-hill-house-mike-flanagan-tv-series>The Haunting of Hill House (Mike Flanagan TV series)</h3>
<p>This story actually blew my mind away. It showed me how you can play
with familiar story elements in totally unfamiliar ways to create
utter and absolute horror. It&rsquo;s a masterclass. The ending was a little
soppy for my taste. But it was sweet too, which is unusual in horror
stories. So, that was not a bad idea. Anyway, this is not a review of
the TV series. Let&rsquo;s get back to the horror elements.</p>
<p>A family lives in a haunted house in order to renovate it before
selling it. But the mother develops a terrible case of being overly
protective of her children and decides to take radical steps to ensure
their absolute safety.</p>
<p>The narration progresses along two different timelines at the same
time. One shows what happened at the haunted house. The other shows
what happened after their stay at the haunted house: the aftereffects
and consequences.</p>
<p>The children, now all grown up, have problems revolving around their
experience at the Hill House. Their relationship with the father has
deteriorated because he has not told the children what actually
happened at the Hill House on the night of haunting, and they think
their father left their mother to die in a deserted place, alone and
helpless. The viewers get to know the real story as the kids get to
know them.</p>
<p>The series explores what effects disbelief and distrust can have in a
family. It shows the members of a family uniting to resolve all their
conflict together, helping each other. What it definitely was not is a
cheap haunted house story.</p>
<h2 id=outlining-vs-discovery-writing>Outlining vs Discovery Writing</h2>
<p>Some writers need to plot the story before they start writing. Some of
them just start writing, trusting the story to advance itself. Most of
them do a little bit of both.</p>
<p>Do you need to think about the implications of your story before you
finish it? No. But you should ponder about the humane elements after
you have finished writing it. Your first draft won&rsquo;t be perfect. It
does not need to be; nobody is going to see it. What matters is the
final piece.</p>
<p>In an interview, the writer-director of Get Out, Jordan Peele,
discusses the idea behind the Sunken Place. He explains that the fear
of being trapped in in his own body and not being in control of it has
been haunting him from early childhood. He just brought that fear onto
the page. But when he read it afterwards, he understood the connection
between the Sunken Place and the minorities feeling powerless and
voiceless. &ldquo;I started crying,&rdquo; he says to the interviewer.</p>
<h2 id=endings-are-hard>Endings are Hard</h2>
<p>Horror is good. Give it a chance.</p>
