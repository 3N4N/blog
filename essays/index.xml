      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone out much in the lockdown, and the few times I have gone out, it was after dark. So when I stepped outside today at ten a.m., it was the first time in two years I have seen the sun from outside the building I eat, shit, and sleep in.
I did not miss the constant stink of spilled garbage in this city, but the perfect temperature and pleasant breeze more than made up for it.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine posted a humorous status on Facebook, satirizing the Bangladeshi people who were agreeing with the Black Lives Matter movement in America. His argument was that we prefer women with lighter skin tone to darker one, and so we have no right to judge Americans while being entrenched in racism ourselves.
Of course, he and I both knew that sexual attraction has little to do with racism, but I could not shake the feeling of a deep-rooted connection between the two.</description>
